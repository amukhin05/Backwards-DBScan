# Backwards-DBScan

This is a very rough version that doesn't really work as of now (but is hopefully pretty cool). 
I would like to add a way to check if points are AT MOST original eps away from other points in the cluster, as this is an identifies issue.  
There are other issues (seen visually) which have an unidentified origin as of right now.
Sorry for the lack of comments in the code - I will work on that.
DISCLAIMER: parts of the code were taken from the internet, but all ideas are originally mine, and were not influenced by any internet searches
